# Project Launcher Bash Tool

> **Automated macOS Workspace Launcher**

A productivity-focused bash script that allows quick switching between home and work development environments. Automatically closes unnecessary apps, selects projects interactively, and opens appropriate browser and editor based on your work mode.

## üì¶ Project Structure

This is a simple standalone bash script. You can place it anywhere in your system.

---

## üîß Features

- Interactive mode selection: Home / Work
- Hides all currently open apps (except Terminal and Finder)
- Closes Visual Studio Code cleanly before launching a new project
- Interactive directory scan for selecting a project folder
- Automatically opens preferred browser (Brave for Home, Firefox for Work)
- Opens Xcode Simulator after switching

---

## üíª Usage Instructions

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Set your project paths

Modify these two variables at the top of your script to match your system directories:

```bash
HOME_DIR="$HOME/Development/REact"  # <-- Your home projects folder
WORK_DIR="$HOME/Development/Codenicely"  # <-- Your work projects folder
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Make the script executable

```bash
chmod +x launcher.sh
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Run the script

```bash
./launcher.sh
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Select Mode

- `h` ‚Üí Home Mode
- `w` ‚Üí Work Mode
- `-1` ‚Üí Exit

You‚Äôll then get an interactive list of all project directories inside the chosen folder. Pick a project number, and it will launch the correct browser + VS Code instance.
